# Cypress E2E Testing for E-commerce Application

This project is an end-to-end (E2E) testing suite for an e-commerce application using Cypress. The testing framework is built using Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) with Cucumber and follows the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern.

## Project Structure

- **cypress/e2e/features/**: Contains the feature files written in Gherkin syntax.
- **cypress/e2e/step_definitions/**: Contains the step definitions for the feature files.
- **cypress/support/pageObjects/**: Contains the page object models for the application.
- **cypress/reports/**: Contains the test reports generated by Mochawesome.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Configuration

- **Cypress Configuration**: The configuration is defined in `cypress.config.js` (startLine: 1, endLine: 20). It includes settings for viewport size, default command timeout, and the URL of the application under test.

- **Environment Variables**: The base URL for the application is set in the `env` property of the Cypress configuration.

## Running Tests

- **Run all tests**:
  ```bash
  npm test
  ```

- **Run tests in headed mode**:
  ```bash
  npm run headedMode
  ```

## Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)

The project uses the `cypress-cucumber-preprocessor` to enable BDD. Feature files are located in the `cypress/e2e/features/` directory, and step definitions are in `cypress/e2e/step_definitions/`.

### Example Feature File

gherkin
Feature: e2e flow for ecommerce application
Scenario: End to end ecommerce validation
Given I am on Ecommerce Page
When I login to the application
And I add items to cart
And Validate the total price limit and checkout
Then Select the country submit the address and verify the success message

## Page Object Model (POM)

The project is structured using the Page Object Model design pattern. This helps in maintaining the code by separating the test logic from the page structure.


## Reporting

Test results are reported using `cypress-mochawesome-reporter`. Reports are generated in JSON format and can be found in the `cypress/reports/` directory.

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing Step Definitions**: Ensure that step definitions are correctly placed in the `cypress/e2e/step_definitions/` directory. If a step definition is missing, you will see an error message with suggestions for implementation.
